**Description** - The program will take a provided video file to automatically add a specified TV Rating icon into the video file without the need for a video editing software. Some TV broadcast software does not have the ability to handle these TV Rating systems as this program can automate the process of adding TV Ratings directly into the video files. The "src" folder contains the rating images as these can be replaced with your own images if your images are the same resolution and named the same. There is also a "video.mp4" that is meant to be replaced with your own video as long as it is the same resolution and named the same.

**Features** - The program will take video files that can have a TV Rating icon added into it. Users will have the ability to pick which TV Rating to add as the program will know how to overlay it and for how long to overlay the rating into the video. The program can then export the final video out.
